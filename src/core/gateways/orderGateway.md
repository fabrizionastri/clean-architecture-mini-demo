At first glance, the two versions of the `orderGateway` function seem to do the same thing, but they behave differently due to the way JavaScript (and therefore TypeScript) handles `this` context.

Here is a closer look at both:

1. `orderGateway2` is creating new functions `getAll` and `getById` which internally call the corresponding methods on the `orderAdapter` object. Here, the `this` context inside these methods, if used, would refer to the `orderAdapter` since that's where the methods are actually being called from.

```typescript
export const orderGateway2 = (orderAdapter: any) => {
  return {
    getAll: (): Order[] => orderAdapter.getAll(),
    getById: (orderId: string): Order => orderAdapter.getById(orderId),
  }
}
```

2. `orderGateway3` on the other hand, is directly assigning the methods from `orderAdapter` to the new object it returns. In this case, the `this` context inside these methods, if used, could potentially change. In JavaScript, when you directly assign a method to a new variable or object property, the `this` context is not retained. If `orderAdapter.getAll` or `orderAdapter.getById` make use of `this` to access other properties or methods on `orderAdapter`, this won't work in `orderGateway3` because the `this` context will now refer to the object returned by `orderGateway3` and not `orderAdapter`.

```typescript
export const orderGateway3 = (orderAdapter: any) => {
  return {
    getAll: orderAdapter.getAll,
    getById: orderAdapter.getById,
  }
}
```

These differences wouldn't matter if the `orderAdapter` methods do not use `this` at all. But if they do, you could experience different behavior between `orderGateway2` and `orderGateway3`.
